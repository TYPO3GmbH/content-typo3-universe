### TYPO3 certification exam takers

The confidentiality obligations and other terms set forth below (the "Agreement") are a contract  between you  and the
TYPO3 Association. This agreement exists to protect the overall  certification process. By adhering to this  agreement,
you help maintain the integrity of the TYPO3 certification program.

### Definition of "confidential information"

"Confidential information" includes all information or material that has or could have
value or other utility in terms of certification and examination.

### You understand, acknowledge, and agree to the following:

* Confidential information is property of the TYPO3 Association and is protected by laws governing the ownership of intellectual property.
* You are prohibited from copying, disclosing, publishing, reproducing, or transmitting any information concerning certifications, in whole or in part, in any form or by any means, verbal or written, electronic or mechanical, for any purpose.
* That your obligations under this agreement shall continue in effect after your engagement for the certification team as a team member, regardless of the reason or reasons for termination and whether such termination is voluntary or involuntary.

Violating any of the terms of this agreement will result in the immediate revocation of any existing  TYPO3
certifications and your permanent ineligibility to obtain any TYPO3 certification. You acknowledge that monetary damages
may not be a sufficient remedy for unauthorized use or disclosure  of the confidential information and that, without
waiving any other rights or remedies, the TYPO3  Association may seek injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed
proper by a court of competent  jurisdiction, without obligation to post any bond, to remedy or prevent disclosure or
misuse of confidential information.

By signing this agreement, you confirm that you understand and accept all of the terms and conditions  of this agreement.
You understand that you are under no obligation to accept these terms, but that  your acceptance is required in order to
take a TYPO3 certification exam.
