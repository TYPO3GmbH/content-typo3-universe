Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.

Information on the data transfer to third-party countries that are not secure under data protection law and the transfer to US companies that are not DPF-certified

We use, among other technologies, tools from companies located in third-party countries that are not safe under data protection law, as well as US tools whose providers are not certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF). If these tools are enabled, your personal data may be transferred to and processed in these countries. We would like you to note that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in third countries that are insecure in terms of data protection law.

We would like to point out that the US, as a secure third-party country, generally has a level of data protection comparable to that of the EU. Data transfer to the US is therefore permitted if the recipient is certified under the “EU-US Data Privacy Framework” (DPF) or has appropriate additional assurances. Information on transfers to third-party countries, including the data recipients, can be found in this Privacy Policy.

**Recipients of personal data**

In the scope of our business activities, we cooperate with various external parties. In some cases, this also requires the transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only disclose personal data to external parties if this is required as part of the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the disclosure of this data. When using processors, we only disclose personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract on data processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.

**Revocation of your consent to the processing of data**

A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.

Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)

IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).

IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).

**Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency**

In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.

**Right to data portability**

You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.

Information about, rectification and eradication of data

Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to demand information about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data at any time. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any time.

**Right to demand processing restrictions**

You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the following cases:

* In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.

* If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of this data.

* If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its eradication.

* If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.

If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – with the exception of their archiving – may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.

**SSL and/or TLS encryption**

For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from “http://” to “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.

If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

Encrypted payment transactions on this website

If you are under an obligation to share your payment information (e.g. account number if you give us the authority to debit your bank account) with us after you have entered into a fee-based contract with us, this information is required to process payments.

Payment transactions using common modes of paying (Visa/MasterCard, debit to your bank account) are processed exclusively via encrypted SSL or TLS connections. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from “http://” to “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.

If the communication with us is encrypted, third parties will not be able to read the payment information you share with us.

**Rejection of unsolicited e-mails**

We herewith object to the use of contact information published in conjunction with the mandatory information to be provided in our Site Notice to send us promotional and information material that we have not expressly requested. The operators of this website and its pages reserve the express right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of promotional information, for instance via SPAM messages.

## 4. Recording of data on this website

**Cookies**

Our websites and pages use what the industry refers to as “cookies.” Cookies are small data packages that do not cause any damage to your device. They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or they are permanently archived on your device (permanent cookies). Session cookies are automatically deleted once you terminate your visit. Permanent cookies remain archived on your device until you actively delete them, or they are automatically eradicated by your web browser.

Cookies can be issued by us (first-party cookies) or by third-party companies (so-called third-party cookies). Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services of third-party companies into websites (e.g., cookies for handling payment services).

Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically essential since certain website functions would not work in the absence of these cookies (e.g., the shopping cart function or the display of videos). Other cookies may be used to analyze user behavior or for promotional purposes.

Cookies, which are required for the performance of electronic communication transactions, for the provision of certain functions you want to use (e.g., for the shopping cart function) or those that are necessary for the optimization (required cookies) of the website (e.g., cookies that provide measurable insights into the web audience), shall be stored on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, unless a different legal basis is cited. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the storage of required cookies to ensure the technically error-free and optimized provision of the operator’s services. If your consent to the storage of the cookies and similar recognition technologies has been requested, the processing occurs exclusively on the basis of the consent obtained (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 (1) TDDDG); this consent may be revoked at any time.

You have the option to set up your browser in such a manner that you will be notified any time cookies are placed and to permit the acceptance of cookies only in specific cases. You may also exclude the acceptance of cookies in certain cases or in general or activate the delete-function for the automatic eradication of cookies when the browser closes. If cookies are deactivated, the functions of this website may be limited.

Which cookies and services are used on this website can be found in this privacy policy.

**Consent with Complianz**

Our website uses Complianz’s consent technology to obtain your consent to store certain cookies on your device or for the use of certain technologies and to document this consent in a manner compliant with data protection regulations. The provider of this technology is Complianz B.V., Kalmarweg 14-5, 9723 JG Groningen, the Netherlands (hereinafter “Complianz”).

Complianz is hosted on our servers, so no connection to the servers of the provider of Complianz is established. Complianz stores a cookie in your browser in order to be able to allocate the consents granted to you or their revocation. The data collected in this way is stored until you request us to delete it, delete the Complianz cookie yourself or until the purpose for storing the data no longer applies. Mandatory legal storage obligations remain unaffected.

Complianz serves to obtain the legally required consent for the use of cookies. The legal basis for this is Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR.

**Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax**

If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these data on without your consent.

These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is required for the performance of pre-contractual measures.

**Gravatar**

We have integrated Gravatar on this website. The provider is Automattic Inc., 60 29th Street #343, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA (hereinafter Gravatar).

Gravatar is a tool that lets you provide personal images (avatars) to users of our website. The avatars serve as visual representations of the users and are displayed wherever a user interacts with the platform (e.g., in forums or chats). When a user interacts with the platform, their avatar is displayed based on the choices associated with their email address. This adds a personal touch to the users' online presence and simplifies the identification process, as the selected image is associated with the users when they are active online.

The use of this analysis tool is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the analysis of user patterns, in order to optimize the operator’s web offerings and advertising.

**IP anonymization**

For analysis with Matomo we use IP anonymization. Your IP address is shortened before the analysis, so that it is no longer clearly assignable to you.

**Hosting**

We host Matomo exclusively on our own servers so that all analysis data remains with us and is not passed on.

**Google Ads**

The website operator uses Google Ads. Google Ads is an online promotional program of Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.

With the aid of Mailjet we are able to analyze our newsletter campaigns. For example, we can see if a newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked. In this way, we can determine which links have been clicked particularly often.

We can also see whether certain previously defined actions were performed after opening/clicking (conversion rate). For example, we can tell if you have made a purchase after clicking on the newsletter.

Mailjet also allows us to classify newsletter recipients into different categories (“clusters”). For example, the newsletter recipients can be subdivided according to age, gender, or place of residence. In this way, the newsletters can be better adapted to the respective target groups. If you do not want Mailjet to analyze you, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a corresponding link in every newsletter message. Furthermore, you can unsubscribe from the newsletter directly on the website.

For detailed information on the functions of Mailjet, please refer to the following link: [https://www.mailjet.de/funktion/](https://www.mailjet.de/funktion/).

Mailjet’s privacy policy can be found at: [https://www.mailjet.de/sicherheit-datenschutz/](https://www.mailjet.de/sicherheit-datenschutz/).

**Legal Basis**

Data processing is based on your agreement (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). You can revoke this agreement at any time. The legality of the data processing operations that have already taken place remains unaffected by the revocation.

Data transfer to the US is based on the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission. Details can be found here: [https://www.mailjet.de/av-vertrag/](https://www.mailjet.de/av-vertrag/).

Storage period

The data deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter or the newsletter service provider and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data stored for other purposes with us remain unaffected.

After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address may be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist, if such action is necessary to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used only for this purpose and not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with the legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is indefinite. You may object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.

Data processing

We have concluded a data processing agreement (DPA) for the use of the above-mentioned service. This is a contract mandated by data privacy laws that guarantees that they process personal data of our website visitors only based on our instructions and in compliance with the GDPR.

## 7. Plug-ins and Tools

**YouTube with expanded data protection integration**

This website integrates videos from the YouTube website. The operator of the website is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.

When you visit one of these websites on which YouTube is integrated, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. This tells the YouTube server which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube account, you enable YouTube to assign your surfing behavior directly to your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.

We use YouTube in extended data protection mode. According to YouTube, videos that are played in extended data protection mode are not used to personalize browsing on YouTube. Ads that are played in extended data protection mode are also not personalized. No cookies are set in extended data protection mode. Instead, so-called local storage elements are stored in the user's browser, which contain personal data similar to cookies and can be used for recognition. Details on the extended data protection mode can be found here: [https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780).

After activating a YouTube video, further data processing operations may be triggered over which we have no influence.

The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online content in an appealing manner. Pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, this is a legitimate interest. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 (1) TDDDG, insofar the consent includes the storage of cookies or the access to information in the user’s end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG. This consent can be revoked at any time.

For more information on how YouTube handles user data, please consult the YouTube Data Privacy Policy under: [https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en).

The operator of this website has no control over the data transfer. In case Google Maps has been activated, Google has the option to use Google Fonts for the purpose of the uniform depiction of fonts. When you access Google Maps, your browser will load the required web fonts into your browser cache, to correctly display text and fonts.

We use Google Maps to present our online content in an appealing manner and to make the locations disclosed on our website easy to find. This constitutes a legitimate interest as defined in Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 (1) TDDDG, insofar the consent includes the storage of cookies or the access to information in the user’s end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG.

The data tracked during such analyses are forwarded to Google.

reCAPTCHA analyses run entirely in the background. Website visitors are not alerted that an analysis is underway.

Data are stored and analyzed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the protection of the operator’s websites against abusive automated spying and against SPAM. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 (1) TDDDG, insofar the consent includes the storage of cookies or the access to information in the user’s end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG.

**Data processing through social networks**

We maintain publicly available profiles in social networks. The individual social networks we use can be found below.

Social networks such as Facebook, X etc. can generally analyze your user behavior comprehensively if you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g., like buttons or banner ads). When you visit our social media pages, numerous data protection-relevant processing operations are triggered. In detail:

If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social media page, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. Under certain circumstances, your personal data may also be recorded if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this case, this data is collected, for example, via cookies stored on your device or by recording your IP address.

Using the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user profiles in which their preferences and interests are stored. This way you can see interest-based advertising inside and outside of your social media presence. If you have an account with the social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on any device you are logged in to or have logged in to.

Please also note that we cannot retrace all processing operations on the social media portals. Depending on the provider, additional processing operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media portals. Details can be found in the terms of use and privacy policy of the respective social media portals.

**Legal basis**

Our social media appearances should ensure the widest possible presence on the Internet. This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. The analysis processes initiated by the social networks may be based on divergent legal bases to be specified by the operators of the social networks (e.g., consent within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR).

**Responsibility and assertion of rights**

If you visit one of our social media sites (e.g., Facebook), we, together with the operator of the social media platform, are responsible for the data processing operations triggered during this visit. You can in principle protect your rights (information, correction, deletion, limitation of processing, data portability and complaint) vis-à-vis us as well as vis-à-vis the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g., Facebook).

Please note that despite the shared responsibility with the social media portal operators, we do not have full influence on the data processing operations of the social media portals. Our options are determined by the company policy of the respective provider.

**Storage time**

The data collected directly from us via the social media presence will be deleted from our systems as soon as you ask us to delete it, you revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses. Stored cookies remain on your device until you delete them. Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular, retention periods - remain unaffected.

We have no control over the storage duration of your data that are stored by the social network operators for their own purposes. For details, please contact the social network operators directly (e.g., in their privacy policy, see below).

Your rights

You have the right to receive information about the origin, recipient and purpose of your stored personal data at any time and free of charge. You also have the right to object, the right to data portability and the right to file a complaint with the responsible regulatory agency. Furthermore, you can request the correction, blocking, deletion and, under certain circumstances, the restriction of the processing of your personal data.

This technical data is processed so that the content on the server can be transmitted from the web server to the end device used and can be correctly processed and displayed by the browser or app. After each page visit, some of this data is stored in logs by the web host that provides the server. The web host processes this data for the purposes of maintenance and security of its server, but deletes IP addresses after 14 days at the latest, usually sooner. The server for this instance is operated by a professional host based in the European Union. The servers are also located in Europe. As a processor, the host is subject to the instructions of the instance operators and is contractually obliged to comply with technical and organizational security measures.

Data processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) and (1) (b) GDPR to the extent necessary to enable access to the home page and registration within the framework of the user relationship between the operators of the instance and the users, as well as to fulfill the obligation to take technical and organizational protective measures.

2. Data processing during registration

Basic account information is processed during registration. This includes account name, email address, and password. Additional profile information such as a display name or biography can also be entered, and a profile picture or header image can be uploaded. The account name, display name, biography, profile picture, and header image are then always displayed publicly (usually also to people who do not have their own Mastodon profile) and transmitted to federating instances. All of this information is also accessible to the operators of this instance at a technical level.

The data processing described in the context of registration is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1b) GDPR to the extent necessary to enable access to the login interface or to carry out the registration within the scope of the user relationship.

3. Data processing during use of the Mastodon account

1. Posts, followers, and other public information:  
   The list of accounts that are followed is publicly displayed. The same applies to followers. As soon as a post is published, the date and time are stored in the database of this instance, together with information about which application was used to publish it. Posts may contain media attachments, such as images and videos. Public and unlisted posts are publicly available. Once a post is pinned to the profile, it is also publicly available. Posts are displayed to all followers. If these followers have accounts on other instances, this means that the posts are delivered to these other servers (other instances) and copies of the posts are stored there. Once posts are deleted, the deletion is reported to the followers' servers. However, there is no way to absolutely ensure that the other instances will actually implement such a deletion request. If third-party posts are shared, they are always public.

2. “Only followers” and “Only mentioned” posts: All posts are stored and processed on the server of this instance. “Only followers” posts are delivered to followers and mentioned users. “Only mentioned” posts (sometimes misleadingly referred to as “direct messages”) are only delivered to mentioned users. “Only mentioned” posts are not end-to-end encrypted and are therefore – technically – also visible to the operators of the instances of the mentioned users. The same applies to responses to polls. The operators of this instance cannot control whether the operators of other instances handle this data appropriately. For this reason, it may be advisable to check the instances of your followers. It is also possible to manually accept or reject new followers. No sensitive information should be shared on Mastodon, not even via “mentions only” posts.

3. Internet Protocol addresses (IP addresses) and other metadata: When you log in to the instance, the server of that instance records both the IP address from which the login originated and the name of the browser application. All logged-in sessions are available for review and revocation in the settings. Mastodon normally stores the last IP address used for up to 12 months. However, this instance has been configured to delete the IP address immediately after processing.

4. It is possible to share information with particularly sensitive content on Mastodon, both about yourself and about third parties. The information may relate to racial and ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, as well as the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the unique identification of a natural person, health data, or data concerning the sex life or sexual orientation of a natural person (Art. 9(1) GDPR).

5. This instance communicates with many instances in the Fediverse, including instances outside the European Union.

Data processing in the context of use is generally carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1b) GDPR to the extent necessary to enable the use of the Mastodon account within the scope of the user relationship.

Insofar as data pursuant to Art. 9 (1) GDPR is affected, the information of the data subject is processed in accordance with Art. 9 (2e) GDPR, provided that the data subject has obviously made the data public.

Insofar as data is processed on instances outside the European Union, the processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 49 (1b) GDPR. 

4. Use of cookies

Mastodon uses cookies (small text files that make the browser uniquely distinguishable from others) to provide core and convenience features. When visiting the server on which this Mastodon instance runs, cookies are stored in the user's memory via the web browser. These are technically necessary session cookies. They are used to store the status of the login process, the session, and the page that was last visited.

5. Data processing in email communication

When users contact the administration of the instance by email, the email address and the content of the message are processed and stored for the purpose of handling the communication. This information is stored for as long as necessary to respond to the content of the request. Unless the specific nature of the communication requires otherwise, old emails are generally deleted one year after receipt of the last response and contact details are deleted after two years.

The storage and use of the data contained in the emails and the contact details is carried out to the extent necessary on the basis of the legitimate interest of the instance operators in handling communication with users, provided that this does not conflict with their interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).

6. Data processing when embedding third-party content

If media, especially videos, are shared from external services (e.g., links to video hosting services such as YouTube or PeerTube instances), they are embedded in the post using a so-called iFrame. Initially, only a preview image (“preview card”) is displayed, which is stored in the local cache of the Mastodon instance. The video is only played after clicking on this preview image. Clicking on the preview image establishes a connection to the server on which the media is located. As soon as this connection is established, the information listed under point 1, among other things, may also be transmitted to those responsible for the third-party offering. Processing by these responsible parties is no longer subject to the control of the instance operators.

7. Users' rights

Users have the right to request information about their personal data processed by the instance operators (Art. 15 GDPR).

1. to request that inaccurate data be corrected (Art. 16 GDPR).
2. have data deleted if, for example, it is no longer necessary for the original purpose or there is a dispute as to whether certain data is being processed lawfully (Art. 17 GDPR).
3. have processing restricted if the conditions of Art. 18 GDPR are met.
4. to receive the personal data concerning them that has been provided to the instance operators in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format (Art. 20 GDPR).
5. to object at any time, on grounds relating to their particular situation, to processing based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (Art. 21 GDPR).
6. to lodge a complaint against the instance operators with the data protection supervisory authorities.

With regard to all of the above rights vis-à-vis the instance operators, the following applies: Contacting us using the contact details provided in the legal notice is sufficient to exercise these rights.
